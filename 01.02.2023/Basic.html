  <h3>4 DNS[Domain Name System] server involved in loading</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>DNS recursor</dt>
    <dd>The recursor can be thought of as a librarian who is asked to go find a particular book somewhere in a library.
      The DNS recursor is a server designed to receive queries from client machines through applications such as web
      browsers.
      Typically the recursor is then responsible for making additional requests in order to satisfy the client’s DNS
      query.</dd>
    <dt>Root nameserver</dt>
    <dd>The root server is the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses. It can
      be thought of like an index
      in a library that points to different racks of books - typically it serves as a reference to other more specific
      locations.</dd>
    <dt>TLD nameserver</dt>
    <dd>The top level domain server (TLD) can be thought of as a specific rack of books in a library. This nameserver is
      the next step in the search
      for a specific IP address, and it hosts the last portion of a hostname (In example.com, the TLD server is “com”).
    </dd>
    <dt>Authoritative nameserver</dt>
    <dd>This final nameserver can be thought of as a dictionary on a rack of books, in which a specific name can be
      translated
      into its definition. The authoritative nameserver is the last stop in the nameserver query. If the authoritative
      name server
      has access to the requested record, it will return the IP address for the requested hostname back to the DNS
      Recursor (the librarian) that made the initial request.</dd>
