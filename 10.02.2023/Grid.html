        <p class="Para Para1">There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text, which we didn't get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements described in this article are less known, but still useful to know about (and this is still not a complete list by any means). Here you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.</p>
        <p class="Para Para2">In HTML text fundamentals, we walked through how to mark up basic lists in HTML, but we didn't mention the third type of list you'll occasionally come across â€” description lists. The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers.</p>
        <p class="Para Para3">If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute.</p>
        <p class="Para Para4">If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute.</p>
        <p class="Para Para5">If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute.</p>
        <p class="Para Para6">If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute.</p>
        <p class="Para Para7">If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute.</p>
        <p class="Para Para8">If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute.</p>
        <p class="Para Para9">If a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute.</p>
