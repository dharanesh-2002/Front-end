    <div id="Count">
        <p>The CSS Multi-column Layout Module extends the block layout mode to allow the easy definition of multiple columns of text. People have trouble reading text if lines are too long; if it takes too long for the eyes to move from the end of the one line to the beginning of the next, they lose track of which line they were on.</p>
        <p> Therefore, to make maximum use of a large screen, authors should have limited-width columns of text placed side by side, just as newspapers do.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately this is impossible to do with CSS and HTML without forcing column breaks at fixed positions, or severely restricting the markup allowed in the text, or using heroic scripting.</p>
        <p>This limitation is solved by adding new CSS properties to extend the traditional block layout mode.</p>
