        <p id="Item1">The touch events interfaces are relatively low-level APIs that can be used to support
            application-specific multi-touch interactions such as a two-finger gesture. A multi-touch interaction starts
            when a finger (or stylus) first touches the contact surface. Other fingers may subsequently touch the
            surface and optionally move across the touch surface. The interaction ends when the fingers are removed from
            the surface. During this interaction, an application receives touch events during the start, move, and end
            phases.</p>
        <p id="Item2">Touch events are similar to mouse events except they support simultaneous touches and at different
            locations on the touch surface. The TouchEvent interface encapsulates all of the touchpoints that are
            currently active. The Touch interface, which represents a single touchpoint, includes information such as
            the position of the touch point relative to the browser viewport.</p>
        <p id="Item3">This iterates over the changed touches as well, but it looks in our cached touch information array
            for the previous information about each touch to determine the starting point for each touch's new line
            segment to be drawn. This is done by looking at each touch's Touch.identifier property. This property is a
            unique integer for each touch and remains consistent for each event during the duration of each finger's
            contact with the surface.</p>
